# Clinical use-cases (starter list)

1. **Unified patient timeline** across EHR + labs + imaging + devices.
2. **Radiology correlation**: align report impressions with imaging-derived structured findings.
3. **Longitudinal imaging**: compare studies over time; detect changes and summarize deltas.
4. **Medication safety**: surface interactions + contraindications based on conditions + labs.
5. **Discharge readiness**: summarize care gaps and required follow-ups.
6. **ED triage support**: structured extraction from notes + vitals + labs.
7. **Chronic care programs**: identify missing monitoring, guideline adherence.
8. **Population health**: cohort selection + outcomes tracking.
9. **Research dataset assembly**: reproducible cohort definition and feature extraction.
10. **Patient-facing clarity**: translate complex clinical info into understandable summaries.

Each use-case should be implemented as a **prompt pack + schema + test cases + UX view**.
