# Stakeholder pitch (Dr. Eric Veldman demo)

## One-liner
**MedAtlas maps fragmented medical data into a unified, navigable intelligence graph — enabling faster, safer clinical insight and reproducible research.**

## What you will show
1. A patient-like synthetic record flowing through the system.
2. Timeline navigation (events, labs, notes, imaging references).
3. A structured “AI interpretation” output (JSON) designed for UX consumption.
4. Evidence-first explainability: every claim links to source artifacts.

## Why it matters
- Eliminates data silos
- Enables cross-modal reasoning (text + imaging + labs)
- Provides auditability for AI outputs
- Creates a foundation for scalable R&D and clinical pilots

## The ask
- Identify one high-value pilot workflow
- Agree on evaluation success criteria
- Define governance boundaries (synthetic first, then controlled real data)
